In March of 2016 our family of four boarded a one-way flight to Northern Iraq. I work for an NGO and am a part of team that is developing a medical program to provide pre-hospital care to wounded Peshmerga soldiers in their fight against Daesh (ISIS). 

I love reading books about Christian theology, geo-politics, linguistics, Hellenistic Greek, history, Islam, and all things Kurdish. I am currently learning Sorani Kurdish and working to maintain Greek by reading copious amounts of the Greek New Testament and all of Stanley Porter's books. It's a trip. 

The writing on this site will be a reflection of the above mentioned reading. If you can try to hear my mordant and giggling voice while reading it will be easier to bear.
