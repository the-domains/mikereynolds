I am so grateful for the impact that Calvin's _Institutes of The Christian Religion_ is having on me. I listen to it as an audiobook, make notes in the Audible app where there is some extraordinary insight, then return to those things in the printed work. This system is working out well so far. 

This particular insight about our "blind self-love" is increasingly important to us in the 21st century. If I could comment on anything about my own generation is that we love ourselves with zeal. Deadly and fatal zeal. We have constructed a society in which self-love is a virtue and a proper heavenly perspective of ourselves is utterly unwelcome. To the degree that we shun a biblical self-perspective is the same degree that we are shunning reality. 

Calvin famously begins the Institutes saying, "_The subject handled by the author of these Christian Institutes is twofold: the former, the knowledge of God, which leads to a blessed immortality; and the latter, (which is subordinate to the former,) the knowledge of ourselves._" \[2\] While the knowledge of ourselves is subordinate to the knowledge of God, both are necessary. If the knowledge of God does not produce a damning contrast between his virtue and our incorrigible vice then we are no closer to salvation than when we first began. Many die with some knowledge of God, but not ever looking at themselves in proper contrast they shun whatever profit the knowledge of God would have be to them. Here is an encouragement from Calvin towards "wisdom in the secret heart" (Ps. 51:6) and by grace to be the kind of person who "speaks truth in his heart" (Ps. 15:2). This is an ultimate and essential step towards reality. I'll let him speak: 
> 
> _Let us not decline to descend from this contemplation of the divine perfection, to look into ourselves without flattery or blind self-love. It is not strange that we are so deluded in this matter, seeing none of us can avoid that pestilential self-indulgence, which, as Scripture proclaims, is naturally inherent in all: "Every way of a man is right in his own eyes," says Solomon, (Prov. 21:2.) And again, "All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes," (Prov. 16:2.) What then? does this hallucination excuse him? No, indeed, as Solomon immediately adds, "The Lord weigheth the spirits;" that is, while man flatters himself by wearing an external mask of righteousness, the Lord weighs the hidden impurity of the heart in his balance. Seeing, therefore, that nothing is gained by such flattery, let us not voluntarily delude ourselves to our own destruction. To examine ourselves properly, our conscience must be called to the judgment-seat of God. His light is necessary to disclose the secret recesses of wickedness which otherwise lie too deeply hid. Then only shall we clearly perceive what the value of our works is; that man, so far from being just before God, is but rottenness and a worm, abominable and vain, drinking in "iniquity like water." For "who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one," (Job 14:5.) Then we shall experience the truth of what Job said of himself: "If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say I am perfect, it shall prove me perverse," (Job 9:20.) Nor does the complaint which the prophet made concerning Israel apply to one age only. It is true of every age, that "all we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way," (Isaiah 53:6.) Indeed, he there comprehends all to whom the gift of redemption was to come. And the strictness of the examination ought to be continued until it have completely alarmed us, and in that way prepared us for receiving the grace of Christ. For he is deceived who thinks himself capable of enjoying it, until he have laid aside all loftiness of mind. There is a well-known declaration, "God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble," (1 Pet. 5:5.)

The end result is not damnation, but casting our gaze towards our redeemer and friend who "forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases" (Ps. 103:2). Humility here is not a nice adornment, but a necessary inner reality in order to appropriate the grace provided in the Gospel. Bless the Lord.
