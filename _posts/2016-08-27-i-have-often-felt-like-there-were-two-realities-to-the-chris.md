  I have often felt like there were two realities to the Christian life, the
  reality of sin, flesh, and the devil and the reality of God, redemption, and
  coming glory. The reason I’ve believed in two is because I’ve not been able to

  assume that he is commanding our attention towards a different reality, for
  which we must strive to see with our old and worn out faculties of perception,
  but that he is commanding us to use different faculties to see the same
  reality.

> May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope

I have often felt like there were two realities to the Christian life, the reality of sin, flesh, and the devil and the reality of God, redemption, and coming glory. The reason I've believed in two is because I've not been able to reconcile our existence in this world with what will soon come. When Paul prays that God would fill us "with all joy and peace in believing" we must not assume that he is commanding our attention towards a different reality, for which we must strive to see with our old and worn out faculties of perception, but that he is commanding us to use different faculties to see the same reality.

In my morning devotions I was singing Open the Eyes of My Heart, the 90's worship classic that filled every awkward youth room in America. The words weren't wasted on 90s youth, today I sing this song and ask God to open the eyes of an often wounded and calloused faculty to see my present reality in Christ. I cannot see this reality with my eyes, until the day that my eyes are transformed to see such things(), but with my heart I may grasp in full the wonder of God's present reality. We are people of the future blessedness, planted in the present evil world as a foretaste to sinners who might come to Jesus.
